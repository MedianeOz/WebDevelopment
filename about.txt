# BeirutPoly — The Game of Beirut Hustle & Heritage

Step into the vibrant, chaotic, and endlessly fascinating streets of Beirut with *BeirutPoly* — a Monopoly-style board game that captures the soul of the Lebanese capital. From the trendy cafés of Gemmayzeh to the timeless charm of Hamra, from the Corniche by the sea to the bustling alleys of Bourj Hammoud, this game lets you buy, trade, and negotiate your way through the heart of Beirut.

In *BeirutPoly*, players become entrepreneurs, investors, or dreamers, building their fortunes while navigating the city’s unique twists: power cuts, traffic jams, and unexpected political events. Will you invest in iconic landmarks like Martyrs’ Square or the Pigeon Rocks? Will you risk it all in the souks, or play it safe in the quieter quarters? Local flavors and challenges come alive with custom “Chance” and “Community Chest” cards inspired by real-life Beirut experiences: pay for generator fuel, win a surprise wedding invitation, or get stuck in traffic during rush hour!

A tribute to the resilience and creativity of Beirutis, *BeirutPoly* is more than just a game — it’s a playful reflection of the city’s ups and downs, its joy and its hustle. Whether you're from Beirut, have visited, or dream of walking its streets, this game will give you a taste of life in the capital of contradictions.
